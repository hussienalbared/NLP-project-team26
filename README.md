Sarcasm Detection and Preprocessing Demo

This is a demonstration of sarcasm detection and text preprocessing using machine learning classifiers. The dataset used for training and testing is "train-balanced-sarcasm.csv." The scripts `preprocessing.py`, `feature_encoding.py`, and `sarcasm_detection.py` are used for data preprocessing, feature encoding, and sarcasm detection, respectively. Additionally, the folders `roberta` and `bert` contain their own code and implement RoBERTa and BERT transformers.

Dependencies:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scikit-optimize (skopt)
- torch
- csv
- re
- wordcloud
- collections

Usage:
1. Place the "train-balanced-sarcasm.csv" file in the same directory as the scripts.
2. Run the `preprocessing.py` script to perform data preprocessing and generate visualizations.
3. After preprocessing, run the `feature_encoding.py` script to encode the text data using TF-IDF and GloVe embeddings.
4. Next, you can explore the `roberta` and `bert` folders to see the implementations of RoBERTa and BERT transformers.
5. Finally, run the `sarcasm_detection.py` script to perform sarcasm detection using various ML classifiers and compare their performance.

Note:
- The preprocessing script (`preprocessing.py`) assumes that the input CSV file has a column named "comment" containing the comments and a column named "label" containing the labels (1 for sarcastic, 0 for non-sarcastic).
- The feature encoding script (`feature_encoding.py`) encodes the preprocessed text data into numerical features using TF-IDF and GloVe embeddings. It provides functions to get TF-IDF encodings and GloVe encodings for training and testing data.
- The sarcasm detection script (`sarcasm_detection.py`) relies on the preprocessed and encoded data generated by `preprocessing.py`, so make sure to run `preprocessing.py` first before running `sarcasm_detection.py`.
- The `roberta` and `bert` folders contain implementations of RoBERTa and BERT transformers, respectively. You can explore their code to see how these transformer models are used for text classification.


Happy exploring and experimenting with sarcasm detection, text preprocessing, feature encoding, and transformer models!
